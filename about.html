      <h1>About Velvet Charms — Body Glow</h1>
      <p>Velvet Charms is a small atelier dedicated to handcrafted bodycare and home sensory delights. Our candles, soaps and creams are brewed in small batches, with attention to ingredients, finish and packaging. Every item is touched by hand and often personalised on request.</p>

      <h3>Our approach</h3>
      <p>We prioritise natural ingredients, gentle formulas and unique presentation. Whether you’re looking for a calming lavender face cream or a festive sculpted candle, each product is created to bring comfort and warmth into your home.</p>

      <h3>Personalised commissions</h3>
      <p>Would you like a custom scent, colour, or a tiny inscription? Add a customization note when you order — we’ll confirm any details and estimated timeline via email. Small commissions are usually ready in 1–2 weeks; very large or sculptural items may take slightly longer.</p>
