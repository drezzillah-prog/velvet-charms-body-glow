        <h2>Welcome to Velvet Charms — handmade with care</h2>
        <p>At Velvet Charms we make cozy, heart-warming handmade treasures — candles, soaps, knitted winterwear, paintings, epoxy home pieces and small baubles designed to become little keepsakes in your life.</p>

        <h3>Our approach</h3>
        <p>Everything you see is made with attention to detail and a love for texture: slow-crafted candles with sculptural reliefs, soaps hand-cut and fragranced with essential oils, knitted winter sets brushed for ultimate softness, and mixed-media artworks that combine paint and clay for depth and personality. We source gentle materials and prioritize safe, skin-friendly formulations for our creams and soaps.</p>

        <h3>Personalized commissions</h3>
        <p>We love commissions — portraits, a special mug, or a bespoke set for a gift. When you order a custom piece you can choose materials and scents, send reference photos or sketches, and request specific colors, initials, or messages. Use the product customization box on the product page to add notes and upload one supporting file (image or PDF).</p>
